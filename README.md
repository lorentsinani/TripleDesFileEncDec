# TripleDesFileEncDec
File encryption and decryption using Triple Des (3DES) algorithm.

## Language
We used python in main file but also java to help you if you have any tasks to implement 3DES 2key code.

## Usage
If u want to encrypt and decrypt files you need to download python, then `pip install pycryptodome` in terminal so you can use that library of python. After this just go run file then in 2 steps:
1. file path: type the .txt or any file's path u want to test
2. key: type any keyword u want to encrypt with but remember that keyword is needed to decrypt the file again.
